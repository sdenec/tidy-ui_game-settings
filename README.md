# Tidy UI - Game Settings
**formerly FVTT UII - Game Settings**

A module to make the game settings menu a bit more comfortale to use.
A stand alone module from the upcoming Tidy UI suite module.

The buttons in the Settings Sidebar are arranged to be a little less confusing and are grouped by function.

All Input fields, and buttons are better aligned. Over all the element spacing makes reading and navigating more comfortable.

The Module Manager now has a button to toggle the Module Information so browsing and toggling your installed modules becomes easier.
You also can ckeck and uncheck all modules at once (Tidy UI will stay checked).

Module Settings in the Settings Tab start collapsed and are expandable so you don't have to scroll through endless checkboxes to find the one module you want to set up.

You now can click the titles to check a box (of course the checkbox itself also works).

All Modules in the Manager and Settings Tab are sorted by their displayed name!

-- currently supports the dnd5e Game System --
